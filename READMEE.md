# Cloud Computing and Investment Models

## What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** refers to the delivery of computing resources (such as servers, storage, databases, networks, software, and intelligence) over the Internet (“the cloud”). These services allow the flexibility to access data and systems from anywhere, with simplified scalability and maintenance. Instead of managing an on-premises infrastructure, companies can allocate cloud resources on demand, paying for what they use.

## Types of Cloud

There are three main types of cloud environments, each suited to different needs and usage scenarios.

### Public Cloud

In the **public cloud**, services are offered by an external provider, such as Microsoft Azure, and are available to multiple customers through a shared infrastructure. Examples include:

- **Microsoft Azure**
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**

Advantages:
- Unlimited scalability
- Pay-per-use
- Low upfront costs (no need to purchase hardware)

Disadvantages:
- Less control over security and infrastructure
- Latency may occur due to data center locations

### Private Cloud

In a **private cloud**, the infrastructure is dedicated to a single customer, either maintained in-house or hosted by a third-party provider. Companies with stringent security requirements, such as banks and government agencies, often opt for this approach.

Advantages:
- Greater control and customization
- Better security and compliance with specific regulations

Disadvantages:
- High maintenance and hardware management costs
- Less immediate scalability

### Hybrid Cloud

A **hybrid cloud** combines the public and private clouds, allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This allows a company to keep critical data in a private cloud, while taking advantage of the public cloud for less sensitive or high-demand tasks.

Advantages:
- Flexibility and better allocation of resources
- Maintenance of critical data in private environments
- Use of scalable public cloud resources for dynamic workloads

Disadvantages:
- More complex management
- Integration between environments is not always simple

## Investment Models: Capex and Opex

### Capex (Capital Expenditure)

**Capex** refers to the capital expenditure to acquire or update physical assets, such as servers, networks and data centers. This model involves a high initial cost and ongoing maintenance expenses. It is generally used in **private clouds**.

**Example:**
A company purchases physical servers and builds its own data center. This initial investment is recorded as Capex.

### Opex (Operational Expenditure)

**Opex** is the operational expenditure related to the ongoing use of services and resources. In the context of the cloud, it refers to paying for the use of resources on demand, without the need to purchase hardware. **Public** and **hybrid** clouds tend to use the Opex model more.

**Example:**
A company uses Azure services, paying monthly for virtual machines and storage on demand, with no upfront infrastructure costs.

## Practical Case: Investment Projection

A software company is considering implementing a cloud infrastructure to support its operations and growth over the next 5 years. It has three options:

### Scenario 1: Public Cloud (Azure)
- **Investment model:** Opex
- **Initial cost:** Low, pay-as-you-go.
- **Scalability:** High. The company can scale according to demand without new hardware investments.
- **Estimated monthly cost:** R$ 20,000, including virtual machines, database and backups.

### Scenario 2: Private Cloud
- **Investment model:** Capex
- **Initial cost:** High, around R$2,000,000 to build your own data center.
- **Maintenance:** Requires an internal team to manage and maintain the environment.
- **Estimated monthly cost:** R$100,000 for maintenance, energy and personnel.

### Scenario 3: Hybrid Cloud
- **Investment model:** Capex and Opex
- **Initial cost:** Medium, around R$500,000 to implement a private infrastructure for critical data.
- **Estimated monthly cost:** R$15,000 for using the public cloud and R$50,000 for maintaining the private cloud.

The final decision depends on the expected growth of the company, its security and compliance requirements, and the level of control it wants to have over the infrastructure.
